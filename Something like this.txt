🖥️ Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Component Metadata Analyzer: Current vs Future Architecture

Subtitle: Comprehensive React Project Visualization

Your Name / Date / Company Name

🔍 Slide 2: Current Version Overview
Heading: Current Architecture

Key Points:

Backend analyzes components using ts-morph & fast-glob.

Outputs metadata (state, props, hooks, methods) to JSON.

React frontend uses D3.js to visualize:

Component Interaction

Method Flow

State Flow

Home page allows uploading GitHub repo.

Visual: Insert the "Current Architecture" diagram I provided earlier.

🚀 Slide 3: Future Vision
Heading: Proposed Future Architecture

Key Additions:

Lifecycle usage map (methods and state per lifecycle phase)

Metrics dashboard (component types, state/prop counts, complexity)

AI-powered review and optimization suggestions

Enhanced modular visualizations with tabs

End-to-end GitHub → Analysis → Interactive Dashboard flow

Visual: Insert the "Future Architecture" diagram I gave.

📊 Slide 4: Key Feature Enhancements
Tabular or bullet-point comparison:

Feature	Current	Future
Component Map	✅	✅ Enhanced
Method Flow	✅	✅ Improved
Lifecycle Analysis	❌	✅
Metrics Dashboard	❌	✅
AI Review	❌	✅
Deployment Support (ECS)	Optional	✅

🧠 Slide 5: Benefits of Future Upgrade
Faster debugging and understanding of large projects

Real-time architecture mapping

Simplified onboarding

Supports component reuse

AI-generated insights

🛠️ Slide 6: Technical Stack
Backend: Node.js, ts-morph, fast-glob

Frontend: React.js + TypeScript, D3.js, SCSS

Deployment: AWS ECS (optional)

Optional: OpenAI API for LLM analysis

✅ Slide 7: Next Steps
Finalize Metadata Enhancements

Optimize analyzer.js for full coverage

Deploy React Dashboard

Integrate AI Review module

Testing & Rollout

If you'd like, I can also generate this as a downloadable .pptx file now. Want me to do that?
