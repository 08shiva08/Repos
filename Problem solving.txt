👩‍💻 1. For Developers
Problem:

Difficult to understand unfamiliar codebases

Time-consuming debugging across component trees

No clear insight into lifecycle behavior or state flows

How It Helps:

Auto-generated component maps, state/method flows, and lifecycle diagrams reduce onboarding time

Clear visualizations help spot dead code, unused state, and redundant props

AI review surfaces potential code smells or refactoring opportunities

🧑‍🔧 2. For Architects / Tech Leads
Problem:

Hard to get a bird’s-eye view of component interactions and architectural complexity

No automated way to assess modularity, coupling, and reuse

How It Helps:

Interaction diagrams help evaluate component coupling and design quality

Metrics dashboard quantifies complexity, state usage, and structure

Helps define and enforce architectural patterns through insights

📈 3. For Managers / Project Leads
Problem:

Low visibility into frontend code quality or technical debt

Difficulty estimating onboarding time or refactoring efforts

How It Helps:

Visual overview of project complexity and health

Tracks number of components, code structure, and growth over time

Helps justify or plan time for refactoring or training based on real data

🧑‍💼 4. For Business Stakeholders
Problem:

Often disconnected from the implications of technical complexity

Cannot relate business risks to frontend instability or inefficiencies

How It Helps:

Converts complex codebases into visual project maps they can grasp

Demonstrates where technical debt may block future business features

Strengthens trust in team decisions related to quality and maintainability
