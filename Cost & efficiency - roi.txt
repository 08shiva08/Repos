 Slide 8: Cost & Efficiency Benefits
Benefit Area	Current Approach	Future System Impact
Developer Time	Manual code tracing, longer onboarding	🔻 40–60% reduction via auto-diagrams & metadata
Bug Detection	Manual debugging	🔍 Visual state/method/lifecycle maps enable faster issue spotting
Project Onboarding	Slow understanding curve	📈 New devs grasp architecture in minutes
Code Reviews	Time-consuming	✅ Automated insights + lifecycle view aid reviewers
Rework / Refactoring	Risky and time-intensive	🔄 Visualization ensures safe refactor with context
Tooling Cost	Manual/fragmented tools	🧩 Unified dashboard replaces many separate tools
Collaboration	Less effective cross-team	🤝 Shared visual context improves team communication

📈 ROI Projection (optional chart)
Include a simple bar or line chart comparing estimated:

Developer hours saved

Estimated bug fix time reduction

Time to onboard a new team member

E.g., "From 3 days → 3 hours"

🧮 Slide 9: Estimated Savings (example)
Metric	Baseline	Future System
Avg. Dev Debug Time/Week	8 hours	3 hours
Avg. Onboarding Time	3 days	0.5 days
Avg. Bugs Missed/Release	5	1–2
Yearly Dev Time Saved	~250+ hrs	~650+ hrs

📌 Assumes a mid-sized team of 5–8 developers
